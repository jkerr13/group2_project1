## **Executive Summary**

## **Concept**
We wanted to compare the relationships among different asset classes over a period of time to see if any of them seem to hedge the market during downturns.  The classes that we decided to evaluate are:
* 10-Year Treasury Bonds from different counties
* BITCOIN
* Gold 
* Crude Oil 
* US House Pricing Index

For the 10-Year Treasury Bonds, we wanted to look at various countries who had various economic and political differences to see how they trended.  Based on available data and research, we chose to use the following countires:
* USA
* UK
* China
* India
* Japan
* EU
* Brazil
* South Africa
* Egypt
* Nigeria
* Australia
* Germany
* Canada
* France
* Russia

We decided to use various graphs to plot the daily changes in the price of 10Y T-Bills, daily changes in the price of Bitcoin, daily changes in the prices of gold, daily changes in the prices of crude oil and the changes in US House Pricing Index.

## **Data Collection and Clean-Up**
We used various data sources including Fred, investing.com, alpalca and yfinance.  While gathering the data, we realized that some data was available daily whereas other was only available monthly.  Because of this, we had to clean the data to ensure that we were consistent and able to compare the data.  

We also used various Python packages to help us get, clean and analyse the data.  These packages include:
* pandas
* Path
* fredapi
* alpaca_trade
* alfa_vantage
* yfinance 
* fredapi

By combining these various packages and using them together, we were able to import all our required data, clean the data, analyse the data and create graphs and charts to help tell our story.
